## 💻 Personal Projects

### Souls like combat system UE 5.4

- **Weapon-Dependent Animation System**
Each weapon is its own actor and defines its own attack animations.
Both player and enemies dynamically change their attack animations based on the weapon currently equipped.
- **Combo system**
Evaluating the current player state, different attacks are selected (all stored inside each weapon), and combo chains can be as long as needed.
- **Input buffer system**
Player inputs are buffered while performing uninterruptible actions.
- **Camera targetting**
The camera can lock onto the most centered enemy, with the ability to switch targets left or right using the gamepad joystick for improved combat readability and control.
- **Base enemy class**
Shared enemy base class that controls Damage reception, Pushback reactions and angle dependant hit animations. It also uses a simple Behaviour tree to controll the base enemy behaviour.
