## My objectives
My intention is to start working as soon as posible in the industry. I'm currently finishing my bachelors degree of video game design and development in the CITM-UPC Barcelona and I'm looking for an internship to finish this stage of my life and start working full time in what I really love doing: Developing videogames.

### Knowledges
I’ve used and I have knowledge about programs like Photoshop, illustrator,
3DStudioMax or Zbrush. I consider it important for a **programmer** like me to have not
extensive but enough knowledge in other areas like the artistic one in order to be
able to properly communicate with the art team. Communication is as important as
being able to optimize your work in order to function properly with members of other
departments.
I’m glad to say that I have good design knowledge and I’ve participated as a
designer and gameplay programmer in projects like “The Witcher Ties of Destiny” explained below.

But first of all I’m a programmer. I have extensive knowledge about **c/c++** and I’m
used to program using c# when I’m scripting in Unity, a game engine which I have
good experience working with in several projects during the last few years. I’ve also
programmed in lua scripting language and I have no problem learning new scripting
languages.
I also have the ability and experience to use this programming skills to create a video
game that uses resource management systems, entity or crowd management, well
polished AIs etc.

As a game developer, I’ve been present in most areas and all the stages of the
development in different projects that you can explore below.


## Student Projects


### The Witcher Ties of Destiny
“The Witcher Ties of Destiny” was a game developed in four months by a

OpenGL game engine while this was still in development. This game was
highly liked by professionals from companies like Digital Legends, RayLib
Technologies or Lince works.
