## My objectives
My intention is to start working as soon as posible in the industry. I'm currently finishing my bachelors degree of video game design and development in the CITM-UPC Barcelona and I'm looking for an internship to finish this stage of my life and start working full time in what I really love doing: Developing videogames.

### Knowledges
I’ve used and I have knowledge about programs like Photoshop, illustrator,
3DStudioMax or Zbrush. I consider it important for a **programmer** like me to have not
extensive but enough knowledge in other areas like the artistic one in order to be
able to properly communicate with the art team. Communication is as important as
being able to optimize your work in order to function properly with members of other
departments.
I’m glad to say that I have good design knowledge and I’ve participated as a
designer and gameplay programmer in projects like “The Witcher Ties of Destiny” explained below.

But first of all I’m a programmer. I have extensive knowledge about **c/c++** and I’m
used to program using c# when I’m scripting in Unity, a game engine which I have
good experience working with in several projects during the last few years. I’ve also
programmed in lua scripting language and I have no problem learning new scripting
languages.
I also have the ability and experience to use this programming skills to create a video
game that uses resource management systems, entity or crowd management, well
polished AIs etc.

As a game developer, I’ve been present in most areas and all the stages of the
development in different projects that you can explore below.


## Student Projects


### The Witcher Ties of Destiny
“The Witcher Ties of Destiny” was a game developed in four months by a
class of 20 video games students. It was fully developed in our own c++
OpenGL game engine while this was still in development. This game was
highly liked by professionals from companies like Digital Legends, RayLib
Technologies or Lince works.
I was in charge of: Designer and gameplay programmer

### Mercury Engine
"Mercury engine" is an OpenGL 3D game engine developed in 4 months from scratch programmed in C++ and other libraries such as SDL, DeviL, Assimp, and ImGui . This project pretends to create a game engine which is able to load, import and play animations from fbx models that have been animated in an external animation software such as maya, blender or 3DsMax.

Some functionalities are: 

- Camera: Can create a camera which has a component camera, where you can activate the camera culling and change the fov.

- File System: Every time a file is being dropped in the engine, it stores the file in a own file format to make it faster to read, loading all the info and also maintaining a     relation with a .meta file for each file (Models and Textures)

- Importer
  Material: It load the texture of each model we are importing to store it as a resource and use it later the times we need
  Mesh: Loads a Mesh of a mesh and gets all the models data (vertices, indices, texture coords) to use it later for each object in the Engine.
  Bones: It loads all the bones of each mesh of the model, and stores them individually with its weights and the vertices they are affecting each bone.
  Animations: It loads the animations of the model with all the keyframes of each bone.
  
- Renderer: It renders the models in current time, having the ability to choose in execution time some configurations of render(Depth, Culling, Colors, Textures) enabling and disabling them.

- Resources: Each Mesh, Material, GameObject is stored in separated files with our file format and loaded once in memory.

- Animator: The animator controls the animations of each object, it executes and bind in pose the model every frame, controlling the time of the animation and the positions of the bones that will change the position of the mesh.

Last Resort was my first c++ video game where we had to recreate a full level of
the famous game Last Resort from NeoGeo:
I was in charge of Q&A (as a personal responsibility, but programmed the game as my 3 team
mates)
